1) What did you change/enhance from part 1?
I added one more page for blog posts. Also changed little bit of CSS in two pages: Resume and Course history. 
I also added "translate" functionality in my website.

2) If there was a third part to the class project, what would you like to implement?
In the third part of the project I would add more meaningful content to my website. I have some ideas on how I can make 
"course hisotry" page more meaningful. I can add all the things I have accomplished in each particular class, add some 
final notes (which I can refer anytime in future for my future interviews ) and so on.

3) What did you learn between part 1 and part 2?
The main thing I learned between part 1 and part 2 is javaScript and little bit of JQuery. JQuery I am still not very 
confident about but I do have good understanding of JavaScript now. Also I understad JQuery little bit better which will 
help me in future.

4) What did you like about this project? How could it have been better?
I liked this project. I think it was really meaningful project. I wanted to have my personal website for so long but never was
really able to put this amount of effort in it. Also this class and project in general provided good tools to make
it more easier. Having google is good thing but only if you know what to look for. This is exacty what this project/class
gave me. I really enjoyed making website and as a beginner who didn't know anything about HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP, I feel
like by the end I have accomplished a lot. 

Thank you.
